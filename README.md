# Express API sample with Typescript

About this project:

-	For running the demo in local, you can just run the docker compose, and access the api via http://localhost:8001
-	The basic flow of the API can be seen at test/basic.test.ts
-	This demo is focused on code structure and scalability, without deep implementation on security and edge cases
